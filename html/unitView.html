                    <p><strong>Good landlord, very understanding</strong> - Johnathan Trinh</p>
                    <p>The landlord was great, at one point I accidentally made a hole in the wall (don't ask how,) and the landlord was really nice and calm about it. We worked out what needed to happen to get it fixed quickly, and it was overall just a really good experience. He was understanding on more occasions than just this but I feel like this is probably a good example of it at least.</p>

                    <p>The neighbors around here have always been nice, they chat with me whenever I walk by on the street. There's some great trails near here, and the SkyTrain station is nearby, so that's convenient. Generally just a good setting!</p>

                    <p><strong>Break in</strong> - Grayson Sutton</p>
                    <p>Most of my time was ok, but I can't overlook the fact that there was a break-in once. They smashed the window and stole a lot of valuable jewelry and my laptop, and the police never found them. It made me feel unsafe, and I'm not sure if it was an isolated incident or if it's to do with the neighborhood.</p>

                    <p><strong>Light fixture always broken in the elevator</strong> - Denise Shan</p>
                    <p>The fluorescent light in the elevator was BROKEN the whole time. One of them was fully out constantly, and the other was flickering always. Made me very mad, and the strata did nothing about it. If you don't like flickering lights, this is not the place for you.</p>
