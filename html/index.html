                <h1>What is RentWise?</h1>
                <p>RentWise is an app made to help people looking for homes get real information about the place. Plenty of homes have hidden flaws that can't be found on a walk-through, or that the landlord won't tell you about. By looking at reviews of homes by previous tenants, RentWise helps you get a better picture of the place you'll be living in.</p>

                <h1>Buying? No worries.</h1>

                <div><h1>Who are we?</h1></div>
                <p>We're a small group of programmers who've all been through issues with renting homes before. Be it bad landlords, noisy neighborhoods, or any number of other things, we decided enough was enough and put our efforts into making a solution. We want to make sure that people don't have to deal with these hidden problems anymore, and RentWise is our attempt to do that.</p>

                <h1>Play Nice!</h1>
                <p>Our team of admins will moderate reviews an remove "inappropriate" reviews if they're really bad. In the case of misinformation, there's not much we can do, seeing as this is a community-dependant site. Try to be as honest as you can in your reviews, for everyone's sake. It'll make the site a better place overall.</p>
